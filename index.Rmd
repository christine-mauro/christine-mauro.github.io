####About 
I obtained my BS in Mathematics from [Fairfield University](https://www.fairfield.edu/) in 2008. I obtained my MS (2009) and PhD (2014) in Biostatistics from [Columbia University](http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/biostatistics). My dissertation was advised by [Yuanjia Wang](http://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/yw2016/) and focused on empirically deriving diagnostic rules for psychiatric disorders.

My current research interests include the analysis of clinical trials, longitudinal data analysis, statistical learning techniques, and the application of statistics to problems in mental health and health policy research. I am also very interested in teaching Biostatistics in the health sciences, specifically to a non-mathematically trained audience.
