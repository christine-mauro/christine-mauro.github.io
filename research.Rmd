## Research Areas
My current research focuses on three main areas:

1. The treatment and assessment of Complicated Grief. I serve as the Biostatistician for [The Center for Complicated Grief](https://complicatedgrief.columbia.edu/professionals/complicated-grief-professionals/overview/) at the Columbia School of Social Work. (PI: [M Katherine Shear](https://socialwork.columbia.edu/faculty/full-time/m-katherine-shear/))

2. Assessing the impact of state-level medical and recreational marijuana policies on substance use and other consequences (PI: [Silvia Martins](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/ssm2183)).

3. Assessing the impact of the Affordable Care Act on health insurance and substance use treatment among low income individuals with substance use disorders (PIs: [Mark Olfson](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/mark-olfson-md) and [Ramin Mojtabai](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2111/ramin-mojtabai)).
