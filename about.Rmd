* I enjoy taking my Shih-Tzu, Abby, for daily walks.  
* I have been taking [Pure Barre](http://purebarre.com/) classes for over three years and am close to my 500 class milestone!  
* I love to read and have co-organized a [book club](https://www.meetup.com/Fairfield-20s-and-30s-Womens-Social-Book-Club-Meetup/) for the last several years. You can find me on goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27327534-christine).
